Use Homey to control Xiaomi Mi Home devices (the Mi Home Ecosystem is also branded as MiJia). Xiaomi does not officialy support controlling these devices from outside the Mi Home app. This means that additional steps are needed for pairing these devices with Homey that require technical knowledge. Also be aware that Xiaomi can make changes to it's eco system at any time resulting in Homey not being able to control these devices anymore.

IMPORTANT
Support for Yeelights within this app has been deprecated. Yeelights are now supported through a dedicated app available in the app store. Please migrate your Yeelights to the new Yeelight app.
