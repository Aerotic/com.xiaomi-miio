Use Homey to control Xiaomi Mi Home and Yeelight devices (the Mi Home Ecosystem is also branded as MiJia). Xiaomi does not officialy support controlling most of it's devices from outside the Mi Home app with the exception of Yeelights. Yeelights can be added to Homey quite easy but for all other devices additional steps are needed that require some technical knowledge setting it up. Beware that Xiaomi can make changes to it's eco system at any time resulting in Homey not being able to control these devices anymore.
