Use Homey to control Xiaomi Mi Home devices (the Mi Home Ecosystem is also branded as MiJia). Xiaomi does not officialy support controlling these devices from outside the Mi Home app. This means that additional steps are needed for pairing these devices with Homey that require technical knowledge. Also be aware that Xiaomi can make changes to it's eco system at any time resulting in Homey not being able to control these devices anymore.

GOOD NEWS
Added the ability to control Zigbee devices of Xiaomi gateway that do not require internet and Mi cloud. There are no restrictions on the number of connected Zigbee devices, since you can have multiple Mi Gateway devices and distribute all Zigbee devices between them. When you connect more than 20 devices directly to Homey, some problems and delays may occur. All scripts are processed, especially in Homey, without using Xiaomi servers. When connecting Xiaomi, there is no need to delete them also from the Mihome application. since there are no contradictions between the existing scenarios either.

IMPORTANT
Support for Yeelights within this app has been deprecated. Yeelights are now supported through a dedicated app available in the app store. Please migrate your Yeelights to the new Yeelight app.
